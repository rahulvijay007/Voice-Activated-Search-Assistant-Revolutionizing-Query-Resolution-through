Title: Voice-Activated Search Assistant for URL Retrieval

1. Introduction:

Description of the problem statement: Implementing a voice-activated search assistant for retrieving relevant URLs based on user queries.
Motive behind the model development: To provide users with a convenient and hands-free method for accessing URLs using voice commands.

2. Setting Up Environment and Libraries:

Installation of required libraries such as SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3.
Importing necessary libraries for speech recognition, text preprocessing, and natural language processing (NLP).

3. Data Preprocessing and NLP Setup:

Downloading NLTK resources for tokenization, stopwords, and lemmatization.
Definition of preprocessing functions to clean and preprocess text data.
Integration of voice recognition for user input.

4. Intent-Based Query Processing:

Processing user queries using NLP techniques:
Preprocessing the query text.
Lemmatization of tokens.
TF-IDF vectorization of the query.
Matching the query vector with precomputed TF-IDF vectors of URLs.
Retrieving the most similar URL based on cosine similarity.

5. Chatbot Implementation:

Implementation of a chatbot interface for real-time interaction.
Utilization of voice recognition to capture user queries.
Processing user queries and providing relevant URLs as output.

6. Main Function:

Definition of the main function to orchestrate the entire process.
Preparation of the URL corpus for vectorization.
Vectorization of the corpus using TF-IDF.
Initiation of the chatbot for user interaction.

7. Conclusion:

Summary of the model's functionality and capabilities.
Discussion on potential applications and future enhancements for the voice-activated search assistant.
